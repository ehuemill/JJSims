# JJSims

This program is for simulating the behavior of Josephson 
junctions in the presence of magnetic field with a variety of differnt other parameters that can be tuned.
The other parameter is just another loop, and so the critical current vs field for each of them can be plotted on the same graph.

It is written in Matlab.

Version 1 is the fundemental base that only has the super current vs field graph
Version 2 is the next step in the process and includes a phase offset for half of the junction.

If you are starting a new application, start a branch (most likeley from 002) and knock your self out!
